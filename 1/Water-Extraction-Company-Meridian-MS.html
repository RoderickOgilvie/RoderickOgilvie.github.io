<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of correcting drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew. When damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew take place most often. Regardless of the place or extent of the damage, we advise using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or comparable devices that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Basic home fans are not efficient in moving an adequate quantity of air required to dry a space effectively.</p>
