<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
