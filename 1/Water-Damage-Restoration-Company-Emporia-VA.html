<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.

To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the service on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes.
