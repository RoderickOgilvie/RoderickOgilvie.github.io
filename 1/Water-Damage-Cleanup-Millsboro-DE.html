With our quick reaction, we can help to prevent further deterioration of structural elements and building and construction products but likewise lower the increasing potential health effects that might result from direct exposure to mold.</p>
<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
