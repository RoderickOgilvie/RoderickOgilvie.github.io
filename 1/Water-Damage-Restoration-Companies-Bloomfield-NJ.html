<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is necessary to figure out if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and practical energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure materials and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
