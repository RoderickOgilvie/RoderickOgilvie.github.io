It can be a long-term health risk and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
