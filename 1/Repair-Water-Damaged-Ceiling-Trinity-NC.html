<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
