<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it.

When cutting out around the damaged area, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
