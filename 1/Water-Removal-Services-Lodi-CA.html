<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really respectful person.</p>
