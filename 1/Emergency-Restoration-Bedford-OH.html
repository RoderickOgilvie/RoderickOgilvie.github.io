<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is among the most disastrous things that can happen to a person or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being completely changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may need repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may need replacing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The kind of wood floor covering you may have identifies and limits the type of repairs that require to take place. Strong hardwood flooring permits a wider series of options to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can likewise have replacements for individual planks. The very best method to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
