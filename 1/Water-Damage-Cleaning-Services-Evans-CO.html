Drying fans were installed, heating pads were put on hardwood walls, floorings and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Exceptional, professional care. Really pleased with their quick delivery of emergency service AND their attention to information to guarantee the water damage was dried totally.</p>
