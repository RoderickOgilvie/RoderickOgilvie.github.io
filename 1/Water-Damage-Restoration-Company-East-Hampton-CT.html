<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and keep in mind that permeable surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be removed and changed. If basement carpet has actually ended up being moldy, sweep it (while wearing a mask) to loosen the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to get rid of moisture if it's affixed to the floor.</p>

Please ask your independent tester if their tests, in writing, will stand up in court.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
