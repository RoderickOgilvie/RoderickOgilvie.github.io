<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Specific areas of your home such as crawl spaces, attics and basements are a lot more vulnerable to water damage. Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they thrive. The concrete foundation of your home can trigger dripping in the basement if there is moisture dripping through it. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roof, which can result in mold and decaying. When checking your home for possible reasons for water damage make certain to keep an eye out for moisture in lights in addition to the overall condition of any noticeable piping.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
