<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. Similar to a few of the above methods, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
