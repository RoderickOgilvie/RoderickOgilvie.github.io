Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you might notice little signs like coffee-colored spots that might expand in time.</p>

Basic home fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient quantity of air required to dry a space adequately.</p>
