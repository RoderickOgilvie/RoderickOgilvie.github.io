<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Hackettstown</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health risk and need to be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

And lastly, clean the surface area to eliminate residual mold and spores.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
