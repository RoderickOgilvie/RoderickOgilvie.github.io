<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it might mistakenly press liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and fractures to draw more water out if the phone was completely submerged. When the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is vital to prevent recontamination. You must seal and immediately dispose of products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
