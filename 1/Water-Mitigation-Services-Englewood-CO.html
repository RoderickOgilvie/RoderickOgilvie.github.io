<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is applied to a material, energy is added. Raising the temperature level of a wet product increases the rate of evaporation, further releasing moisture from the product and altering the internal vapor pressure. The higher the distinction between ambient temperature level and humidity temperature level, the greater the potential for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days.

After scrubbing, leave the option for a little while to permit it to permeate through the wood or wall. While the mold cleaner is setting in, you may now clean up the wall debris. Use a vacuum to eliminate the musty wall.</p>
