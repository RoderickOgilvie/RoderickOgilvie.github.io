<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
