There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air.
