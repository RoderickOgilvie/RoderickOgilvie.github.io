<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion throughout damp surfaces of assemblies or materials is a crucial component of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the products or assemblies. Rapid air movement across the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness paves the way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
