<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
