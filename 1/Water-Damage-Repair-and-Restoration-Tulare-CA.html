<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As discussed, quick air motion across damp surface areas of assemblies or materials is a crucial element of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Quick air movement throughout the surface area of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness paves the way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to build much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>
