<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete).

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
