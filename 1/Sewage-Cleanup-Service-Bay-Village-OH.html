<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
