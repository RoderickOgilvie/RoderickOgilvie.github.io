<p>The most important aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. When wet drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew take place most often. No matter the place or extent of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar machines that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard household fans are not capable of moving a sufficient quantity of air required to dry a space properly.</p>
