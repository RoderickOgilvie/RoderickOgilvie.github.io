<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were extremely useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
