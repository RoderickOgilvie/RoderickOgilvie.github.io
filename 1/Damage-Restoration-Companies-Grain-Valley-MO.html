Together, we had the ability to create a new mold-assessment system for business customers that, unlike any other technique or gadget, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so instantly. So when you consider all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
