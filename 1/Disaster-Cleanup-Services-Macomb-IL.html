<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is damp and good, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Eliminate the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and get rid of the battery immediately. Removing the battery rapidly could make the difference to conserve your phone. Most phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has actually damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the moisture out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product overnight. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near to the gadget. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has actually not been exposed to water long.</p>
