Once this combustible fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has actually been warmed to its distinct ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and unpredictable gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause enduring damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most visible, and destructive, product of this chemical reaction.
