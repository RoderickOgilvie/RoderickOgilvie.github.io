Research studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at eliminating airborne mold or surface mold contamination.

<p>It's important to remember that if you have excessive quantities of moisture or humidity in your home, you might find mold growing anywhere, including on the within closet doors, in carpets, and on fabrics. Mold, under the ideal conditions and with a little time can grow.  What may look like a little water leakage can actually result in a more severe mold problem. Mold is naturally happening, it's natures way of turning things back into the dirt; mold is a natural recycler.  In a home or service, mold needs to be resolved appropriately, with the right tools and with the best training.  Our Clay County SERVPRO has that training and can appropriately resolve your mold problem.

<p>Restorers also repair damaged walls and roofing systems. Wetness testing is carried out as a final action to guarantee all concerns connected to the preliminary water damage are fixed. Water damage restoration is the last stage of rebuilding or restoring a home damaged by floodwaters. Dirt-crawl spaces have ended up being a real estate and organisation epidemic. By encapsulating your crawl space you can considerably decrease moisture, mold, radon gas, increasing energy expense, structural damage, loss of storage bug, area and smell problems.<p>
<p>Any mold you kill by scrubbing is just going to come back if there is a water issue. Fix these issues initially. If you presume a leakage, clean the area and see how quickly the mold comes back. If it turns up rapidly, you might need to hire somebody to fix the problem. Water damage resulting from leaking water is progressive, pervasive and it can trigger irreversible damage to your important products. This is particularly a possibility if the emergency response does not get here within very first two days. If you have a flooded basement or ceiling water damage, it is very important to call quickly and get the water mitigation process started to avoid further damage.<p>
