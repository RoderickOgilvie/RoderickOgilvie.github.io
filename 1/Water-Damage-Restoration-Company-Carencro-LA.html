Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components.

If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very costly paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
