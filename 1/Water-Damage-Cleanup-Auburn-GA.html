<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach likewise releases harsh fumes and it even produces toxic gas when mixed with ammonia. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce hazardous fumes or leave poisonous residue. For these factors try to avoid using bleach and if you must utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
