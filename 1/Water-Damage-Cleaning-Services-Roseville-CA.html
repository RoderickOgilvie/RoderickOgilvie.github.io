These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue.
