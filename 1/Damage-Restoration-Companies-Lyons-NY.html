Try to find visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration phase of the job, your experienced cleanup group will utilize the proper combination of cleaning representatives, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers.
