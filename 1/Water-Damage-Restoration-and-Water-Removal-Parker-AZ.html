There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, but the most common kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is warm and moist, it starts to colonize and sprout within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or dangerous gasses are released as the fungi spreads.

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape.
