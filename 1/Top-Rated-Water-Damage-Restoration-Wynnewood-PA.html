<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly harmful. We engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was assigned to verify and evaluate the brand-new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for business clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a crucial tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
