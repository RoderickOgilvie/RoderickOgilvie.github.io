<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who validates the existence of a mold issue needing action and the level of damage then writes a clear scope of work including applicable requirements. This file needs to clearly describe the steps that will be followed by the remediation professional, for example how the afflicted location will be contained or what the verification criteria are. Without a clear arrangement in composing the conclusions, data, measurements are delegated the interpretation of each party.</p>

<p>Likewise, given that bleach is primarily water, on porous surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily absorbed by the product. So, while you might have rubbed out or stained the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually supplied lots of water to regrow and potentially spread out the mold below the surface area. If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
