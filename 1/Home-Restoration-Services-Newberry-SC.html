<p>Lastly, we wish to attend to making use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Specialist Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical sensitivities specifically if utilized in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at getting rid of mold than a mild cleaning agent and a wet fabric, so we recommend the least toxic alternative.</p>
<p>Some air cleaners are created to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing representative and a known irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Research studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at eliminating airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was eliminated by ozone, the health threats would not be minimized up until mold impurities are gotten rid of through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise the use of ozone to deal with mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
