<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over afflicted location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. As with a few of the above approaches, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough.

<p>The most important element of fixing drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew happen most frequently.
