<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
