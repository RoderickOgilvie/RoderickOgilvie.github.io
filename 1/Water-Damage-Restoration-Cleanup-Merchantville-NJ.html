<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
