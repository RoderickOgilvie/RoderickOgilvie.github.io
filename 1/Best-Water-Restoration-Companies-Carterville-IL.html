<h2>What To Do & What Not To Do After Flood Damage in Carterville</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Negative air machines, equipped with HEPA (high effectiveness particle air filters") must be utilized to eliminate bacteria and other contaminants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be drawn out with self-contained vacuum equipment with appropriate waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of correctly. Hard surfaces that are affected need to be cleaned and sterilized. Soft structural products such as carpets, rug, plaster wallboard must be eliminated and effectively gotten rid of. Any material that soaks up substantial quantities of wetness and can not be adequately cleaned must be removed. When contaminated products have been removed, a 2nd application of sanitizers need to be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
