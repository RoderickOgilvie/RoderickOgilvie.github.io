<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth discovering. When the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
