<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Loganville - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
