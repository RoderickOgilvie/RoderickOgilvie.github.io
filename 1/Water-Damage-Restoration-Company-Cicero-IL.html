This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
