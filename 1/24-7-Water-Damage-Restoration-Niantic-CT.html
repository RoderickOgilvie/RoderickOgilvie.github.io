<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, mainly triggering respiratory problems. But in severe cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you presume a mold intrusion, you might want to purchase a mold testing package to see what type of mold spores you're working with, and call in an expert to aid with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home remedies (made with things you most likely already have on-hand) that will help remove mold.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any difficult surfaces to eliminate the mold from the surface area. If anything can be eliminated, such as furnishings, clothing, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are removed, usually involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>

Depending upon the extent of water damage, we have teams prepared for packing and moving belongings in order to clean-out water and inspect and make structural repairs, painting, and improvement.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we want to address the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical level of sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at removing mold than a damp cloth and a moderate cleaning agent, so we suggest the least toxic choice.</p>
<p>This location of the attic is one of the most often impacted areas, which is why it's frequently treated independently. Leaks from the roof will make this area damp, which in turn leads 2 to higher than typical mold development. Cleaning the underside of the deck completely and using scrubbers to guarantee the spores do not spread out is the typical procedure here, and expenses around $500.</p>
