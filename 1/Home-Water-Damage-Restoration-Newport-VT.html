If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
