<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a dripping roofing, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can trigger you stress and anxiety and irritation, specifically if you've never done it before. Mold requires just 3 things to grow and survive: moisture, darkness and humidity. The most common areas in your house for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The best method to prevent mold growth is to get rid of water leaks or moisture in your home. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold avoidance suggestions.</p>

Anything larger needs to be attached to the ceiling joists in order to securely hold the spot's weight in addition to any insulation above it.</p>
