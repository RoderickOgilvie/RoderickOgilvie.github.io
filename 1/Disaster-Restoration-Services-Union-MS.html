How quickly the rust procedure takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
