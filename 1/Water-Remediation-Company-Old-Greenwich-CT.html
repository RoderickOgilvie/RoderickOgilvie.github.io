<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his guys were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to your home and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds.
