<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surfaces begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any hard surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be removed, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to make sure all mold spores are eradicated, generally involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
