These conditions can help in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure products and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
