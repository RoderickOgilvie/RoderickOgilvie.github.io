Food: Undamaged, commercially-prepared foods in all-metal cans or retort pouches can be conserved if you eliminate the labels, completely clean the cans, rinse them, and after that decontaminate them with a sanitizing solution consisting of 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of potable water. Finally, re-label containers that had the labels eliminated, consisting of the expiration date, with a marker.<p>

As household home appliances get older, their pipes may begin to crack and rust and their connections or hoses can weaken as the products age. Fridges, hot water heater, washing makers and dishwaters are all have numerous parts that are prone to wear and tear, so keep a mindful watch on older models. The two biggest perpetrators for water damage in homes are washing makers and hot water tanks.<p>
