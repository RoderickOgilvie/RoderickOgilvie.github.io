<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now declare originated from pressure to build quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Contribute to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much higher.</p>
