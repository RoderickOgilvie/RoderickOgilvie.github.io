Disruptive approaches are utilized when contamination, consumer, damage, or expense issues require removal or adjustment of the affected material. Water damage restoration and cleanup is what our group is here for. If you want to utilize vinegar to avoid mold growing on surface areas just spray vinegar on the surface and leave it.  Repeat this every few days to ensure the surface area will stay mold-free. If you are worried about mold growing on them, you can even mop your tiled restroom floor or other difficult non-porous floorings with vinegar.<p>
