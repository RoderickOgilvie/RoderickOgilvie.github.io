<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Casper</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repairs, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is ended up.<p>
