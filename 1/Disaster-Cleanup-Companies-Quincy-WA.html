<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or methods will be the most efficient. It is imperative to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and practical energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely anticipates the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
