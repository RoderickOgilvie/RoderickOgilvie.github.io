<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and likewise were extremely practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
