<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, developing envelope issues, and building and construction flaws are an extremely major matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing many issues due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, apartments, condominiums, townhouses, hotels, business structures are particularly vulnerable to these concerns as normally the builder farms out the exterior envelope work and wall assembly procedure, for that reason resulting in costs and corners being cut.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that includes a considerable quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may require special methods, longer drying times, or significant water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, triggering significant water build-up. Colby and Caleb arrived on the scene within a number of hours and proceeded to drain pipes the location before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and set up new insulation in the area. They offered exceptional, efficient, and professional service as well as being friendly and enjoyable to work with. I wholeheartedly recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again should the need arise.</p>
