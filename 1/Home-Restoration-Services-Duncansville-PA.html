Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels only show water stains but aren't structurally jeopardized, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When eliminating around the damaged area, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
