<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water easily. This could worsen the issue since as you know - mold likes damp environments.<p>
