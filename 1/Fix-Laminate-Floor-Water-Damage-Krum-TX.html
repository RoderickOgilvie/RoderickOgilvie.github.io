<p>Smoke damage is a typical adverse effects of fire damage, but it can occur by itself if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a product that holds and draws in wetness. This product imitates a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated exhaust air, the moisture evaporates (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

Thankfully, there are actions you can take to prevent a water disaster. As the temperature level drops, keep a stable drip of water going to help avoid freezing. Pay special attention to pipelines in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that may not be getting the same amount of heat as other areas in your home. Wrapping them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in preventing a burst.</p>
