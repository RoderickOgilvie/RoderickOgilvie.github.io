<p>Evaluation reports and claims by 7 next-door neighbors on the block now declare that building flaws allowed water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test showed that some parts of their wall had actually most likely disintegrated and established mold.

<h3>Dealing With Fire Damage Properly in Summerville</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
