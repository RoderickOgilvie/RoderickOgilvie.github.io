<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days.

This includes if they do both testing and remediation, as that is thought about a conflict of interest. We motivate that the conditions be evaluated pre- and post-remediation by an independent certified professional which a different licensed remediation company carry out the work. When not possible, the reason needs to be stated (e.g. remote areas may not have both).<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, kids, employees and others out of the affected area. Attempting to dry the location with a fan might interrupt the spores and spread them to a new location. Getting rid of black mold is a step-by-step procedure that needs persistence, a financial investment in protective equipment and black mold removal products, and, naturally, the courage to brave dark, cramped spaces populated by poisonous fungi.<p>
