<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal visible signs of moisture, leaking water, or indications of stopping working structural stability.
