Senior living centers, homes, condominiums, townhomes, hotels, business structures are particularly susceptible to these issues as normally the contractor subcontracts the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, for that reason resulting in corners and costs being cut.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any hard surface areas to get rid of the mold from the surface.

There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments.</p>
