<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can take place to a person or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may require repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might require changing and often even the subfloor as well. The type of wood flooring you may have identifies and limits the type of repairs that need to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering allows for a larger range of options to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This type of flooring can also have replacements for individual planks. The very best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
