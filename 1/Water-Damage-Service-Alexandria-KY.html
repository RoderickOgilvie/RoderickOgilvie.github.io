<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and likewise were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
