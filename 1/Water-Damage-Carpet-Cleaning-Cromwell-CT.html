<h2>When You Need to Call a Water Damage Restoration Company in Cromwell</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>They called me morning and asked me for assistance. I showed up to access the situation and found the water was running through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was damaged. To contribute to the issue, we had insulated all the floorings and interior walls for sound absorption. All needed to be removed and re-installed throughout the home. We also installed portable heating fans to speed up the drying process.</p>

Our crewmembers have extensive working experience and the company owner, Tim Wesley, has actually had more than 10 years in the restoration organisation.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
