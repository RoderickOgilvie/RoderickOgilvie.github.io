If there is wetness leaking through it, the concrete structure of your home can cause leaking in the basement. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can trigger moisture on the underside of the roofing system, which can cause mold and rotting.

Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days.
