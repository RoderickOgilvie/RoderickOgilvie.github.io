<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Many extremely contagious diseases are linked to water damage including skin infections, liver disease A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's illness, in addition to kidney, blood, and liver issues. Some of the mold on the surface might be killed but the roots of the mold are left intact meaning the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of duplicated lightening. Possibly this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold does not affect it but rather simply whitens its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
