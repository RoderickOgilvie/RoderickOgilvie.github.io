<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another possible result of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Musty smells can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Before your home has actually dried, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff brush, plenty of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by contaminated floodwater should be removed and discarded unless it can be sterilized at a business center for an expense significantly less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile might need to be gotten rid of to permit drying of subfloor.</p>
