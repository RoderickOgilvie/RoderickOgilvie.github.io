<p>Getting rid of among the three requirements for mold minimizes (or gets rid of) new mold development: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat given that mold generally does not grow in cold environments.

<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some artificial items such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs moisture, although some mold types can obtain that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Thoroughly pry baseboards far from walls so that you can check sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can rapidly soak up flood water, and you need to understand the degree of possible damage.<p>
