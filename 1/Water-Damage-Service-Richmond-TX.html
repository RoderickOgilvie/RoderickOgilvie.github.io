<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Richmond</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
