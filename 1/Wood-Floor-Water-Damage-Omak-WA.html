<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice sufficient cooking area upkeep, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from tough surface areas, and repair dripping faucets as soon as possible. Constantly make certain your tableware and serving dishes are dry before saving them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then be sure to dry the area to avoid it from spreading.</p>
