<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
