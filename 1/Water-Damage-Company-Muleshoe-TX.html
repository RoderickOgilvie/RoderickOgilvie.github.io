<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected sprawling suburban houses, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties built with materials aside from stucco had issues, too. Some houses with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and just starts to droop before drying, repairing it might just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
