<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely harmful. Severe flooding and water damage can typically occur in the blink of an eye. Violent weather condition, major plumbing failures or roofing leaks can cause an unexpected surge of water to flood into a home or workplace.

<p>Mold is a common culprit of damage in many of our services and houses here in Central Illinois. Mold spores can spread out rapidly when wetness is present. Typically it can take hold in less than 48 hours after a moisture damage has taken place.

<p>When a client calls with a water damage emergency, our team is prepared to respond immediately.

The longer a water damage situation is left unsolved, the more damage occurs and the issue will end up being more costly to repair.</p>
<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. When this flammable fuel - drywall, carpet, or furniture - has been heated to its unique ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger enduring damage and needs to be handled by experienced experts, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, item of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire comes into contact with additional fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
