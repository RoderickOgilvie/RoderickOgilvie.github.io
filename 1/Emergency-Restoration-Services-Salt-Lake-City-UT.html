The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Making use of chem-sponges is crucial in this stage. When it comes into contact with them, a chem-sponge gathers soot and particles. It also avoids streaking on surface areas and walls.
