Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
