If there is a great deal of mold development, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable versions of these and other assistance documents are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the moldy material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>
