<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
