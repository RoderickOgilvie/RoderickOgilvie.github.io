<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
