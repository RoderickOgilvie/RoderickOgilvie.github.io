<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
