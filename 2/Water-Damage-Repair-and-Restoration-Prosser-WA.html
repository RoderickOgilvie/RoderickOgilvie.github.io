<p>Tear-out of any surfaces that can not be cleaned up follows. This consists of drywall 3, carpets, wallpaper, and other surfaces that might be affected. New surfaces are set up following the removal of the old. This might be as simple as putting up a single sheet of drywall 3, or it may involve the total tear-out and restoration of an entire space depending on the level 1 of damage and mold growth.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes.</p>
