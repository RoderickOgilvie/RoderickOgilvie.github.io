<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Byron</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and ought to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
