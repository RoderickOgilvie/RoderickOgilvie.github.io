Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another prospective impact of water damage. Walls and flooring may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete).

Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
