<p>For safety reasons, they also identify the type of water they're handling prior to starting the water restoration cleanup procedure. You could attempt powering your phone on at this point to examine the damage, however we recommend taking an additional step prior to running the risk of turning the phone on. Submerge your phone in a desiccant-- a compound that will cause dryness by soaking up water. That's simply an expensive way of saying, grab the rice.<p>
<p>Do not touch or attempt to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, draperies or other family textile products. Those cleaning actions will just smear soot into the fabric, making cleaning more difficult. Utilize a dry, absorbent fabric to wipe down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent fabric. Make sure to get the wetness out of the charging port, the volume keys, the headphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
