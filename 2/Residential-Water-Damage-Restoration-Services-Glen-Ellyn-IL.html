<h3>Water Damage Emergency Service in Glen Ellyn Illinois</h2>

Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
