<h3>Water Damage Emergency Service in Glen Ellyn Illinois</h2>

<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
