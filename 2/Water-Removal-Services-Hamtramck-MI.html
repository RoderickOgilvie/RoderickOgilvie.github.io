<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected stretching rural homes, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Residences built with materials aside from stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and just starts to droop prior to drying, fixing it might just need pushing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
