<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
