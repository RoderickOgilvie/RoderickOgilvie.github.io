While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a broad location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
