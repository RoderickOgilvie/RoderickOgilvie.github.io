In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
