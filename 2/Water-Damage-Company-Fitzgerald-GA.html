<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most destructive things that can take place to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being totally replaced. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require repairing.
