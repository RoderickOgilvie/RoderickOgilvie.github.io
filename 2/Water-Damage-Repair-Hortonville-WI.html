<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
