<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were really handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
