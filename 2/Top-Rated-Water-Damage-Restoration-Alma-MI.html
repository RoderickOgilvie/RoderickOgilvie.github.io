If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
