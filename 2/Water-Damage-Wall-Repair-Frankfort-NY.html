<p>Fire damage can frequently compromise walls, roofs, and windows. To keep security and to secure against more damage, the SERVPRO Franchise Professional can board up missing windows and walls and place tarps on damaged roofings. A: Mold needs a moist environment, temperature levels above freezing and a food source, which might be leaves, paper, dirt, wood or other building products. Mold is more likely to be discovered in damp, dusty areas or locations with stagnant air.<p>
<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall materials normally don't dry very well, so if your walls are soaked, it's typically best to rip them out to prevent mold, specifically if they aren't totally dry within 48 hours. Like bleach, ammonia will eliminate mold on tough non-porous surface areas such as counter tops, glass or tiles but it is inefficient at killing mold growing in permeable material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>If you're working with a smaller hole (as much as 6"), apply a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Position your spot into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the compound and allow it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a second layer of joint compound to finish the repair.

We use clinical drying principles and supply validation and documents that your residential or commercial property is dry and the job is complete.<p>
