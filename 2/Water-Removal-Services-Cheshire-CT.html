Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days.
