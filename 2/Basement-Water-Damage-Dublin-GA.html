What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>You wish to attend to bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a best breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold.
