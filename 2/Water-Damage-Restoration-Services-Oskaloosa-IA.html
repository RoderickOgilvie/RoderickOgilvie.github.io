<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling since of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and aggravation, especially if you've never ever done it before. Mold needs just three things to grow and endure: wetness, darkness and humidity. The most typical areas in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The best method to prevent mold development is to remove water leakages or moisture in your home. See our short article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold avoidance tips.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to build faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and builder oversight. Contribute to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
