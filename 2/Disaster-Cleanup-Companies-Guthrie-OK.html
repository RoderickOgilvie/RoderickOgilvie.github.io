<h2>Choosing The Right Water Damage Restoration Service in Guthrie</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally suggest discarding certain types of objects and surfaces. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical products in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which also includes vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles ignored in the remediation process. A special HEPA vacuum ensures that even tiny particles get gathered to decrease the chances of the mold moving somewhere else. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make two times as sure that mold does not find an escape of the contained workspace and into a different part of the structure.</p>
