This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
