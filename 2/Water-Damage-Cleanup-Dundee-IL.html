<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Since typical building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
