<p>Considering that it's difficult to get rid of mold in the house entirely, it is essential to keep your air clear by routinely replacing air filters. Consider using High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger (mold is normally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from circulating.
