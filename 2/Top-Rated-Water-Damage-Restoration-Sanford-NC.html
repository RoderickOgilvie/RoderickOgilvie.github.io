This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very costly paperweight.</p>
