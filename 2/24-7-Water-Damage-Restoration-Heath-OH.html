<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, however to add some clearness to the concern of mold, mold spores are dangerous. They threaten whether dead or alive. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning. Usually, mold spores can be eliminated rather quickly from surface areas. However a stain can remain. An extensive mold remediation and stain removal needs to be carried out to guarantee a safe, indoor air environment.</p>
