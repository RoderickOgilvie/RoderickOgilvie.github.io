<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
