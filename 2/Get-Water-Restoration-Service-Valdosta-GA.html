<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for signs of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache because the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and just begins to droop before drying, repairing it might simply need pressing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
