<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to get the job done correctly.

<p>Don't touch or attempt to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, drapes or other home textile items. Those cleaning actions will just smear soot into the material, making cleaning more difficult.

Make sure to get the wetness out of the charging port, the volume secrets, the headphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
