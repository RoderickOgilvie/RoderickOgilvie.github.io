<h3>Water Damage Covered By Insurance in Senoia Georgia</h2>
<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in hard to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and padding. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across damp surface areas, evaporating wetness into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an enough number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>When standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
