There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air.
