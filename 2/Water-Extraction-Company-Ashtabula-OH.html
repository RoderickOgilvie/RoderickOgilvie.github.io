If the mold is deemed to have actually come from water damage, some insurance companies might make you file a 2nd claim of water damage rather, requiring you to pay another deductible before remediation takes place.</p>

Keep in mind, though, that it is often unwarranted, as the majority of remediation services will proceed the exact same method regardless of what kind of mold is discovered in your home.</p>
