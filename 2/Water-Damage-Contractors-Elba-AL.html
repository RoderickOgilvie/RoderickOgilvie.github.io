Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
