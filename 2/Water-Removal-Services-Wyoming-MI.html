<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Wyoming</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be an irreversible health danger and ought to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
