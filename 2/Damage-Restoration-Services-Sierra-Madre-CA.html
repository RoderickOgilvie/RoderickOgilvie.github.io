<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is damp and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice sufficient kitchen maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from difficult surfaces, and repair dripping faucets as quickly as possible. Constantly make certain your tableware and serving dishes are dry before saving them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surface areas as quickly as it appears, then make certain to dry the area to prevent it from spreading.</p>
