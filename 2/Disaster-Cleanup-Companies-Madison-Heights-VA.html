The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to examine which drying devices or approaches will be the most effective. It is important to identify if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
