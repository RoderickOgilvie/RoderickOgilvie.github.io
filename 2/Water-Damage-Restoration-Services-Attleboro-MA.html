To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall.
