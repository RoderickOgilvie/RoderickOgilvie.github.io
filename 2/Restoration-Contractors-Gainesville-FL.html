Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve.
