<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
