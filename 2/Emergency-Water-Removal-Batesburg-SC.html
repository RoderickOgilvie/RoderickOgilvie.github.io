<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any circumstance, particularly when the hot water heater unit lies inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater impends unless repaired rapidly, and the costs increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the presence of a mold issue requiring action and the level of damage then writes a clear scope of work consisting of suitable requirements. This document needs to clearly explain the steps that will be followed by the remediation contractor, for example how the afflicted area will be contained or what the confirmation requirements are. Without a clear arrangement in writing the conclusions, data, measurements are delegated the interpretation of each party.</p>
