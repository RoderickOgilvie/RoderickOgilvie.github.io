<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout a number of days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
