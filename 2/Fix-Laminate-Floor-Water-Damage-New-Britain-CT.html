<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Residences built with materials aside from stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies.

As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
