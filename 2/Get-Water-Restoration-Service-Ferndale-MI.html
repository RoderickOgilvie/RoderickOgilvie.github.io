<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore security, and cover legs, arms and hands to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of noticeable mold. If the moldy location is dry, gently spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the musty locations, in addition to any surrounding areas. Make sure it won't discolor the material or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials utilized in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a nearby exit instead of the main house, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>
<p>After the water and wetness have been removed the next step to repair water damage is to clean and sanitize the impacted locations. Flood water often brings sewage and other contaminants with it. These impurities should be eliminated prior to final repairs are performed. Industrial cleaners and industrial sanitizers will make sure that your home is successfully cleaned and treated.</p>
