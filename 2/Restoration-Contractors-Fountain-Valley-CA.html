<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
