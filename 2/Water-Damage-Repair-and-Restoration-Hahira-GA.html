When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
