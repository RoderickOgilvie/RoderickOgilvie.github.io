It's an unfortunate reality that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Probably the most typical is the smashed screen, which we discuss in our short article on getting a damaged iPhone fixed However the 2nd most common is water damage. Parts of a water-damaged home may need to be rebuilt. Materials like drywall and carpet that have actually absorbed water often establish bacteria and mold that can't be gotten rid of. Changing these products is safer than allowing contagious organisms to saturate the air.<p>
<p>When handling damp drywall, keep in mind to wear safety goggles and masks. Use a laser level or other gadget to mark 6 inches above the waterline around the room if you're dealing with a basement flood scenario.
