<p>Now the mold is eliminated. In the process of attending to mold growth, Mold Solutions NW uses a range of specialized items. One product we use is MMR, an industrial grade tool that gets deep beneath the external layer to destroy mold. Additionally, we address the discolorations often caused by a mold growth. Mold can stain things like wood as it grows, leaving behind permanent cosmetic damage even after it is gone. MMR helps Mold Solutions NW address stain concerns along with mold development by getting under the surface area on impacted locations.</p>

<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for a period of time, become completely damaged (i.e. they will never ever be the very same). Other products may merely need to be decontaminated and relocated to high ground. Soft products like clothes, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can schedule you. Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Classifications of Water), and that will factor into the equation of what can be saved and what need to be changed. We will work with you throughout the loss, setting aside products that we feel can not be successfully brought back so you can make a list to turn into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then figure out a compensation for your items according to the terms of your policy.</p>
