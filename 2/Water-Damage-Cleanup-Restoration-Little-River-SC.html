If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>
