<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion across damp surface areas of materials or assemblies is a critical element of efficiently and effectively drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface vary from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Fast air movement across the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness gives way to reducing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials need various criteria for changing conditions.</p>
