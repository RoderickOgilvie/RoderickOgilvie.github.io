Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
