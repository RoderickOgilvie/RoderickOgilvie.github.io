<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially look for any safety risks, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry.

If your insulation has actually been affected, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely deal with it. If they have been damaged, we will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>
