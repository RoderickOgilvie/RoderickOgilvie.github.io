<h3>Wood Damaged By Water in Cos Cob Connecticut</h2>
<p>We just recently had significant water damage due to a cleaning machine overflow. Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action necessary to avoid more damage working late into the night. They likewise finished the entire dry which took several days and a great deal of hard work. Constantly gotten here on time and did what they promised and kept me informed of each action. It was a satisfaction to handle the entire group. I would not hesitate to recommend them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>A good way to avoid mold from growing in your house is to lower humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, inspect your home for leaks. Mop it up rapidly and dry the area if water does enter your home.
