<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Since the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water, getting it wet can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and just begins to droop before drying, fixing it may simply require pressing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
