<p>The most essential element of treating drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew. When damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew take place most regularly.

Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air needed to dry a room adequately.</p>
