The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of numerous days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
