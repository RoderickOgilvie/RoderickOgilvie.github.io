<p>Remove the gadget from the water as rapidly as possible, and remove the battery immediately. Getting rid of the battery rapidly could make the difference to conserve your phone. Many phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has damaged the device. You can try to draw the moisture out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product overnight. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget.
