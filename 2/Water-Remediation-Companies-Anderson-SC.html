<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible indications of moisture, leaking water, or indications of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or collapse under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you might observe little indications like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand with time.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that attorneys now declare originated from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>

Changing drywall 1 is normally one of the least pricey of repair jobs for water damage, with a typical cost of $1,500. Projects like hardwood floor replacement are a lot more expensive with expenses in excess of $4,000. More pricey products will show a higher price tag.
