<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable signs of wetness, dripping water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or fall apart under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster material. Other times, you may observe little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand in time.</p>
<p>Because the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water, getting it wet can develop into a significant headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop before drying out, fixing it may just require pressing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
