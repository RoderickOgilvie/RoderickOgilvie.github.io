<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were really valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
