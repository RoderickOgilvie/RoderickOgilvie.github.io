<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
