When water intruded in our home we decided to fight back and it became our mission to help other families through the procedure and after-effects of water damage. In 2014 we opened SERVPRO of West Sioux Falls to execute that mission and respond to the questions of the unknown.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a big brush, and bear in mind that permeable surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall might require to be eliminated and changed.

Anything larger must be connected to the ceiling joists in order to safely hold the spot's weight as well as any insulation above it.</p>
