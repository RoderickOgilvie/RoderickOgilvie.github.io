<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can happen on its own if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier develops the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up moisture through chemical attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a product that holds and attracts moisture. This material acts like a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated exhaust air, the moisture vaporizes (desorption) and is carried outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
