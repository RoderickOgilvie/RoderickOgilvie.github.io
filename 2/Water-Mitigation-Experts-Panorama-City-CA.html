Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach due to the fact that it is safe to use and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave behind harmful residue or produce toxic fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
