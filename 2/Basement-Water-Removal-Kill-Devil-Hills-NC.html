<p>Numerous extremely contagious illnesses are connected to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's disease, along with liver, kidney, and blood concerns. Some of the mold on the surface area might be killed but the roots of the mold are left undamaged indicating the mold soon returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated whitening. Perhaps this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold doesn't affect it however instead just bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
<p>While the iPhone 7 and later are waterproof, it doesn't stop water from entering into the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later on have a comparable concern, although they come with a built-in feature that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a specific frequency. The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to trigger health effects. Mold can set off allergies and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold. As mold needs water to grow it is important to avoid moisture and humidity issues in buildings, especially ones affected by water.<p>
