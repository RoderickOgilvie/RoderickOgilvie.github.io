<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish wear and tear of products (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, oxygen, metal and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no reliable timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components generally begin corroding right away after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can operate usually for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of an issue. How quick the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
