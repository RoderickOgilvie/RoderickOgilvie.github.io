<h3>Mold Damage Restoration in Willows California</h2>
<p>Particular areas of your home such as crawl basements, attics and areas are a lot more prone to water damage. Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they grow. The concrete structure of your home can trigger leaking in the basement if there is moisture leaking through it. Condensation in the location between the attic and your home can trigger moisture on the underside of the roofing, which can lead to mold and rotting.
