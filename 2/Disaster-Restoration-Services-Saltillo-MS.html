<h3>Water Removal From Basement in Saltillo Mississippi</h2>
<p>Certain sections of your home such as crawl areas, attics and basements are a lot more prone to water damage. Dark, damp crawl areas can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they grow. The concrete foundation of your home can cause leaking in the basement if there is moisture leaking through it. Condensation in the location in between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roofing, which can result in mold and rotting. When inspecting your home for potential causes of water damage be sure to keep an eye out for wetness in lighting fixtures along with the overall condition of any noticeable piping.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
