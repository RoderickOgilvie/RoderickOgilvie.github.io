<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of moisture in the home are all very crucial in controlling high humidity that often triggers mold development in our climate.</p>
