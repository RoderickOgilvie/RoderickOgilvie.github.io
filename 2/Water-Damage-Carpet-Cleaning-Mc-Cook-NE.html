<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Mc Cook</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By minimizing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
