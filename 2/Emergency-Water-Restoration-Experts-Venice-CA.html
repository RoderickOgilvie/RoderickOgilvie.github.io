<p>Before making any repairs, you require to discover the source of the water leakage. This can be frustrating, however if you don't repair the source of the water issue initially, repair work will do you no great.

Water can take a trip far from the leakage and trigger damage somewhere you wouldn't expect it. This implies you have to do some expedition and investigation. Remove damaged drywall so that you can better see where the leakage is coming from (see Action 2) and so you can dry out the water-damaged area.</p>
