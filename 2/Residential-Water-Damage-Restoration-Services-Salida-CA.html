<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the space you're repairing so that you know just how much new wallboard you require. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a spot to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and then protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel satisfies. Then use joint substance over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the compound dry for the time specified by the maker and then sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper up until the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
