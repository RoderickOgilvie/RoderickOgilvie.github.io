<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in International Falls</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts typically suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. There's no requirement to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly.
