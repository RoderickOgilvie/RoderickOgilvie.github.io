<p>If you're dealing with a smaller hole (approximately 6"), apply a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Place your patch into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Plume the edges of the substance and permit it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a 2nd layer of joint substance to complete the repair. As water and storm damage experts, we have the experience and advanced training that allows us to restore your property quickly.

<p>Air scrubbers are a type of mold remediation tool utilized to cleanse the air. Air scrubbers eliminate pollutants from the air consisting of mold spores that might be lingering due to water damage. To set up an air scrubber through a HEATING AND COOLING specialist, expect to pay around $1,500. Today, with the prevalent usage of drywall vs. plaster, crafted wood products vs. wood, and using vinyl wall-coverings, wetness can become trapped and provide the needed environment for mold development.
