Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas below. Or merely get a new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the entire time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area if you scrub the spots.</p>

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier because it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Utilizing paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning.

At this point, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>
