<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected stretching rural homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties built with materials besides stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>

Not only is this step crucial in developing an effective action plan that will lead to a successful restoration of your home to its pre-flood condition, however this damage control will also be used by your insurer to value your payout (if you have appropriate flood insurance protection).</p>
