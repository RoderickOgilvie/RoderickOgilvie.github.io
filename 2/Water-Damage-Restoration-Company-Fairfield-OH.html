<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Fairfield</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health danger and must be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Dry thoroughly and rapidly. If the energies are on, use the air conditioning or heater, fans, and a dehumidifier or desiccants to speed drying.
