<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
