<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the steady and sluggish deterioration of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no trusted schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components usually begin wearing away immediately after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of a problem. How quickly the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
