<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
