Ensure that you get to the root cause of the molds and you must open up the walls to find them. Scrub the surfaces with a mold cleaner and do this completely. After scrubbing, leave the service for a little while to allow it to penetrate through the wood or wall. While the mold cleaner is embeding in, you might now clean up the wall debris. Utilize a vacuum cleaner to get rid of the musty wall.</p>
