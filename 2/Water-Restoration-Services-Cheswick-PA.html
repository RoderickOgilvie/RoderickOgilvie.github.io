<p>Mold is a fungi that can be discovered both indoors and outdoors. No one understands how many species of mold exist but estimates range from 10s of thousands to possibly three hundred thousand or more. Mold spreads and recreates by making spores. Spores can make it through conditions that are too warm, hot, cold, dry or damp for mold to grow. They can be carried by air or water to brand-new areas when spores are released.</p>
<p>An excellent way to prevent mold from growing in your home is to minimize humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, check your home for leakages. If water does enter your home, mop it up rapidly and dry the area. Likewise, try to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not drizzling, of course) or placing fans in your space. And keep your indoor humidity below 60%.</p>
