<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a wet towel. Just like some of the above approaches, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Because the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water, getting it damp can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop prior to drying out, repairing it might simply need pressing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
