<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be.
