<p>The most important element of fixing drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew occur most often when wet drywall sits with insufficient ventilation.

Basic home fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient quantity of air required to dry a space adequately.</p>
