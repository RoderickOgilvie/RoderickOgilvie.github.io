Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
